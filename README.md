# CyberSec Warfare: Tools for Securing the Digital World

## About Me

Hello! I’m **Dylan Leonard**, the founder of **CyberSec Warfare**. My passion for cybersecurity goes beyond just a job—I live and breathe it. Over the years, I've honed my skills and expertise to break down paid cybersecurity tools like **Tenable**, **Splunk**, **ProcessUnity**, and others, reverse engineer them, and create my own versions that are accessible for everyone. 

My mission is to help cybersecurity teams improve their security posture by providing them with tools that are **open-source**, **effective**, and **easy to use**. Through my company, I’m creating a suite of security tools that enable organizations to **identify vulnerabilities**, **mitigate risks**, and **protect their data**. 

### Why CyberSec Warfare Exists
I created CyberSec Warfare because I believe the world deserves tools that are as powerful as those in commercial products, but accessible to everyone—whether for personal use, smaller organizations, or teams wanting to stay ahead of threats. I’m committed to helping the cybersecurity community advance by developing security solutions that anyone can use, **without breaking the bank**.

## Tools I've Created

Here are some of the tools I've developed to address modern cybersecurity challenges:

---

### **AutoRed - Adaptive Red Team Engine**

**Purpose**: AutoRed is an AI-driven tool designed to simulate sophisticated, real-world attacks. It includes real modules for attacks like **brute-forcing**, **payload drops**, **SQL injections**, and much more. With **adaptive AI**, AutoRed evolves its tactics based on your environment, making it more difficult for detection systems to block.

**Key Features**:
- Brute-force and payload drop modules.
- Real-time adaptive attack patterns.
- Designed to enhance incident detection and response strategies.

**How it fits the job description**: This aligns with the job’s requirement for hands-on experience in penetration testing and vulnerability management, with a focus on attack simulation.

### **WebHound-AI - Advanced Web Security Scanner**

**Purpose**: WebHound-AI scans websites at a **nation-state level**, looking for a variety of threats such as **obfuscated JavaScript**, **suspicious domain patterns**, and **exploit payloads**. It goes deep by decoding base64 JavaScript, flagging suspicious patterns, and offering **detailed domain analysis**.

**Key Features**:
- Aggressive scanning of HTML, JS, CSS, and images.
- Base64 script decoding and analysis.
- Deep domain extraction and reputation scanning.

**How it fits the job description**: This tool demonstrates expertise in **web application scanning**, **malicious JS detection**, and **domain reputation**—all of which are key components of vulnerability management in web and IoT environments.

### **RiskRank-AI - CVE Risk Scoring Engine**

**Purpose**: RiskRank-AI analyzes **CVE data**, enriching it with **EPSS**, **CVSS**, and **business logic** to produce **priority risk scores**. This tool helps organizations prioritize patching based on risk exposure, making it highly effective for managing vulnerabilities at scale.

**Key Features**:
- CVE enrichment with EPSS and CVSS scoring.
- Customizable business logic for risk scoring.
- Prioritization for remediation based on risk assessment.

**How it fits the job description**: This tool is perfect for **automated vulnerability scanning solutions**, particularly in IoT and AI/ML systems, as it provides actionable insights based on security assessments.

### **SLAWatchdog - Service Level Agreement Tracker**

**Purpose**: SLAWatchdog monitors **third-party vendor vulnerabilities**, automates **SLA tracking**, and ensures that your organization stays compliant by providing automated notifications for vulnerabilities tied to **contractual SLAs**.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time tracking of SLA compliance for vulnerabilities.
- Automated alerts and remediation recommendations.
- Detailed reports on SLA status and threat levels.

**How it fits the job description**: SLAWatchdog provides continuous monitoring of vulnerabilities within third-party vendor environments, contributing directly to **Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM)** as described in the job.

---

### **PatchProof-Py - Post-Patch Verification Tool**

**Purpose**: PatchProof-Py simulates post-patch vulnerability scanning for confirmation. It helps verify that patches applied to the system effectively resolved vulnerabilities and ensures that no new threats were introduced during the process.

**Key Features**:
- Simulated scanning of patched systems.
- Report generation on patch success or failure.
- Helps security teams confirm the effectiveness of patches.

**How it fits the job description**: This tool is critical for **vulnerability management** and **post-patch verification**, ensuring security fixes are correctly applied and vulnerabilities do not persist.

---

### **AutoBlue - Remediation Orchestration Engine**

**Purpose**: AutoBlue automates the remediation of vulnerabilities by triggering patches for critical CVEs, validating their effectiveness, and rolling back if necessary. It leverages **contextual risk analysis** to make decisions about remediation.

**Key Features**:
- Automated patch deployment and rollback.
- Integration with patch validation systems.
- Contextual risk analysis to prioritize patching.

**How it fits the job description**: AutoBlue's automated patching, validation, and rollback directly support **vulnerability management** and **remediation orchestration**, making it ideal for the job's focus on reducing risk exposure in IoT and AI environments.
